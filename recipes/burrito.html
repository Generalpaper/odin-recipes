        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The <em>classic</em> burrito bowl. Instead of wrapping up the plethora of ingredients snugly into an oily tortilla covering, the ingredients are instead laid out in a bowl(go figure) and the main socure of carbohydrates is instead rice.
            It's a spin on a classic dish that managed to become more popular, due to purported claims that it was more healthy.
        </p>
        <p>So what exactly does a burrito bowl contain? Well, its simply a rice bowl that has a large variety of vegetables and meat placed on top of the rice.
            Sounds simple? Great, let's start cooking. <strong>><a href="https://www.joshuaweissman.com/post/burritobowl">Recipe taken from here!</a></strong>

        <h3>For the Rice:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse your rice thoroughly until the water runs clear. Then place your dry rice in a rice cooker, cover with your 3 cups of water, close the lid and cook as directed by the manufacturer. </li>
            <li>Once the rice is done, immediately add your butter, juice and zest of 1 lime, cilantro, and salt to taste. Stir until evenly distributed and incorporated. Taste and adjust salt levels as needed. </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>For the Chicken:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to <strong>375 degrees Fahrenheit</strong>.</li>
            <li>Combine all ingredients except the chicken in a bowl and mix until well combined. </li>
            <li>Add your chicken and toss until coated evenly. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes but ideally overnight. </li>
            <li>To cook you can heat a grill pan (or regular medium sized pan) over medium high, grease with cooking spray. Once the pan is nearly smoking, add your chicken in batches to avoid overcrowding. Sear for 2 minutes per side, transfer to a foil lined baking sheet, and place in the oven to finish cooking for 8-10 minutes or until the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 165 Fahrenheit. </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>For The Corn Relish:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Char your corn by placing it directly on the open flame of a cooktop or range on all sides lightly, then remove the kernels and place in a bowl. Repeat this charring process with your jalapenos but this time charring every part of the chili. Once the chili is fully charred, wipe off the char using a paper towel. Optionally remove the seeds and finely dice. Place in the bowl along with the corn. </li>
            <li>Combine all remaining ingredients and stir until everything is thoroughly combined. Taste and adjust salt and vinegar levels as needed. </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>For the Pickled Red Onion:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium sauce pot combine vinegar, water, and salt. Set on the stove over medium high heat. Place your sliced onions in a heat proof container such as a mason jar.</li>
            <li>As soon as your vinegar mixture begins to boil, remove from the heat and pour directly over your red onions. Ensure that your onions stay submerged under the hot liquid. Leave out to cool until it reaches room temperature. Then cover with a tight fitting lid and leave in the fridge to keep good for many many months.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>For The Black Beans:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium saucepot add in your vegetable oil and set over medium heat. Once hot add your onion, serrano, garlic, and tomato. Season to taste with salt and saute until the vegetables begin to soften. About 3-5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add in your chicken stock bring to a boil over medium high, then reduce the heat to low. Simmer until the liquid is reduced by half, about 4 minutes. Then add your black beans. Reduce for another minute. </li>
            <li>Season your beans to taste with salt and pepper and keep warm.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Assembly:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>If you’re making the mayo, simply combine all ingredients in a medium sized bowl and whisking together until combined.</li>
            <li>Place a base of your rice in bowls divided between the number of servings. Top with each element creating small mounds all around the bowl. Once your bowls are topped with everything, add cheese if you’re using it, and garnish with fresh cilantro and enjoy.</li>
